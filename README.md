# Restaurant Review App
---
## Project Overview: Udacity FEND Project 5

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I was provided starter code with a lot of issues. I had to:
* Convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays
* Make accessible for screen reader use
* Add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Install
** You must use your own API key to properly run this program. Insert your API key at the top of main.js file where it says `<please-insert-your-API-key-here>` **

1. Clone this repo. 
2. Insert API key.
3. You can use a live server or you can follow the directions below:

In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this.
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000
